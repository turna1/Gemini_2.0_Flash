# Let's build with Gemini 2.0 Flash E
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that serve as starter guides for working with Gemini 2.0. These notebooks provide examples and templates for spatial and general tasks to help you get started quickly.
Gemini 2.0 is Google's latest large language model (LLM), succeeding the original Gemini. It's designed to be multimodal, meaning it can understand and operate across different types of information like text, code, images, audio, and video.

*   **Multimodality:** This is a core feature. Gemini 2.0 aims to seamlessly integrate various data types, allowing for more complex and nuanced understanding and generation of content. For example, it could analyze an image and generate a detailed text description, or take a text prompt and create a corresponding image.
*   **Improved Reasoning and Coding:** Google has emphasized advancements in Gemini's reasoning abilities, making it better at problem-solving and logical deduction. It also shows improved performance in coding tasks, including generating, explaining, and debugging code in multiple programming languages.
*   **Scalability and Efficiency:** Like many modern LLMs, Gemini is designed to be scalable, meaning it can be deployed on various hardware and handle different workloads. Efficiency improvements mean it can potentially run faster and use fewer resources.
*   **Different Sizes:** Similar to other LLMs, Gemini comes in different sizes (Ultra, Pro, Nano) to balance performance and resource requirements. Ultra is the most powerful, while Nano is designed for on-device applications.

**Capabilities for Beginners:**

Imagine Gemini 2.0 as a very advanced assistant that can:

*   **Understand and generate text:** Write stories, poems, articles, summaries, translate languages, answer questions in a comprehensive way.
*   **Work with images:** Describe what's in a picture, create images from text descriptions, answer questions about images.
*   **Help with coding:** Write code in various programming languages, explain what code does, help find errors in code.
*   **Handle different types of information together:** For example, you could give it a picture and ask it to write a story about it, or ask it to create a piece of code based on a textual description and an example image.

Essentially, it's a versatile tool for various creative and practical tasks, going beyond just text-based interactions. It's designed to be more intuitive and capable by understanding and working with the world in a more holistic way, similar to how humans do.
